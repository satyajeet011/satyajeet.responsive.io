        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Simply South Indian Food</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">South Indian cuisine includes the cuisines of the five southern states of 
            India—Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana—and the union territories of Lakshadweep, Pondicherry, 
            and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.There are typically vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for all five states. 
            Additionally, all regions have typical main dishes, snacks, light meals, desserts, and drinks that are well known in their 
            respective region.
            Food is generally classified into six tastes: sweet, sour, salt, bitter, pungent and astringent. A traditional Tamil 
                culinary belief is that one should include all six tastes in each main meal eaten. Each taste has a balancing ability 
                and including some of each provides complete nutrition, minimises cravings and balances the appetite and digestion.<p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">North Indian cuisine is collectively the cuisine of Northern India, which includes the
             cuisines of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and 
             adjoining western Bihar..
             North Indian curries usually have thick, moderately spicy and creamy gravies. The use of dried fruits and nuts is fairly 
             common even in everyday foods. Dairy products like milk, cream, cottage cheese, ghee (clarified butter) and yogurt play an 
             important role in the cooking of both savory and sweet dishes. Thanks to the fact that such a rich variety of fruit and
              vegetable is available at all times of the year, the region produces a dazzling array of vegetarian dishes.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Chinese Food</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Chinese Recipes-In a country where the traditional way to greet someone translates to 
            'have you eaten yet?' (ni chile ma), be rest assured, the food will be extraordinary. China has the most popular culinary 
            heritage in the world. The history of their cuisine dates back to about 1000 years with varied cooking styles, techniques 
            and ingredients that have evolved over time.A typical Chinese meal will have two things - a carbohydrate or starch like 
            noodles, rice or buns, and accompanying stir fries or dishes of veggies, fish and meat. They use a lot of fresh vegetables 
            like mushroom, water chestnuts, bamboo and even tofu. In North China, wheat-based accompaniments like noodles and steamed 
            buns dominate the table, in contrast to South China where rice is a favourite. The short-grain sticky rice, grown throughout
            outhern China, is absolutely irresistible.</p>
